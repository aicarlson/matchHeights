matchHeights
============

matchHeights is a simple, very lightweight (322 bytes) jQuery plugin to equalize heights across elements.

The only option it accepts is `true` which will force exact heights using CSS `height` instead of the preferred default, `min-height`

Usage
-----

`$('.elements').matchHeights();`
or
`$('.elements').matchHeights(true);`
